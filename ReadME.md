Here is a list of projects I have worked on individually and as part of teams, during my Bachelor's at IIT Hyderabad.

| Project | Individual/Team | Course | Year | Degree | Code Language | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |  :--- |
|VAE based Scene Reconstruction | Individual | Mini Project | 4th Year | Computer Science | Python | Variational Autoencoder based Latent space interpolation to construct intermittent-weather scenery images for supporting Autonomous driving database. |
|Trust Rank Algorithm | Team | Fraud Analytics | 4th Year | Computer Science | Python | An iterative algorithm that gives the probability of a web page being spam based on an important observation - that good web pages rarely point to bad ones. |
|Random Forest | Individual | Foundations of Machine Learning | 4th Year | Computer Science | Python | Random Forest from Scratch performed on Spam classifier Data. |
|Modelling and Optimization of Horizontal Drum Washing Machine | Team | Modelling and Simulation | 3rd Year | Mechanical Engineering | MATLAB | Optimization (via Genetic Algorithm) of spring-damper system parameters in a rotating washing machine to reduce vibrations. |
|SIR Modelling | Individual | Introduction to Data Structures | 3rd Year | Computer Science | C | COVID Disease spread analysis of a population (interconnected graph) modelled via Susceptible-Infected-Recovered Model. |
|Parallel Greedy Graph Colouring | Individual | Operating Systems | 3rd Year | Computer Science | C++ | Using the power of Parallel computing to power a greedy algorithm to compute a suitable solution to Graph Colouring Problem |
|FEM Analysis of Buckled Beams | Team | Finite Element Methods | 2nd Year |Mechanical Engineering | MATLAB | Numerical analysis of buckling is performed using Finite Element Method technique. The solution is compared with the exact analytical solution. |
|3D Modelling | Team | Introduction to Digital Fabrication | 1st Year | Mechanical Engineering | STL | 3D Modelling of claw shape using Solid Edge framework. |
